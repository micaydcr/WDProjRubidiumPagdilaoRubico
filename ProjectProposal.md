### DESCRIPTION:

**MiCayke** Decorating is a simple yet interactive web game where users can design and decorate their own cakes. In freeplay mode, players can drag and drop toppings like strawberries, icing, sprinkles onto the cake‚Äìall in which will have pastel visuals and smooth animations. Beyond this, the game also offers a challenge mode where players can test their skills with random cake themes and a time limit! If you want to save your cakes, an option will be given where you can save a .png version of your design. This game aims to encourage creativity and design skills by letting players freely express themselves through the decoration.

### WEBSITE OUTLINE:

***1. Home Page***
